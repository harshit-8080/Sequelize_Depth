1.  Eager Loading is the act of querying data of several models at once (one 'main' model and one or more associated models).

2.  Fetching an aliases associations :- 

        const users = await User.findAll({

            include: { 
                model: Tool, 
                as: 'Instruments' 
            }
        });
        console.log(JSON.stringify(users, null, 2));


3. Required eager loading  (By default sequelize do left outer join but we can do inner join using required option inside include)
        
        User.findAll({
            include: {
                model: Task,
                required: true
            }
        });

4.  By default sequelize do left outer join, But we configure it do it right outer join and inner join as well.

        1.  If mention reauired:true, Then Inner join will happen.
        2.  If mention right:true, Then right outer join will happen.
        3.  Example :-

                User.findAll({
                    include: [{
                        model: Task,
                        right: true // will create a right join
                    }]
                });

                User.findAll({
                    include: [{
                        model: Task,
                        required: true,
                        right: true // has no effect, will create an inner join
                    }]
                });

                User.findAll({
                    include: [{
                        model: Task,
                        where: { name: { [Op.ne]: 'empty trash' } },
                        right: true // has no effect, will create an inner join
                    }]
                });

                User.findAll({
                    include: [{
                        model: Tool,
                        where: { name: { [Op.ne]: 'empty trash' } },
                        required: false // will create a left join
                    }]
                });

                User.findAll({
                    include: [{
                        model: Tool,
                        where: { name: { [Op.ne]: 'empty trash' } },
                        required: false
                        right: true // will create a right join
                    }]
                });


                // Fetch all models associated with User
                User.findAll({ include: { all: true }});
