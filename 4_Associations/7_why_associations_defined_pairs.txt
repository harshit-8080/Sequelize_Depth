            We deine associations in pairs because of following condition :-


1.  If we define only once then only source model will get to know about associations.
2.  And we define in pairs both model will get to know about associations.

3.  Example :-

    1.  Relationship exist something like 
        db.team.hasOne(db.player);
        db.player.belongsTo(db.team)

    2.  So now, Both source and target model knows about associations. Then now we can do

            1.  const team = await db.team.findAll({
                     include:db.player
                })
            

            2.  const playerInfo = await db.player.findAll({
                    include:{
                        model:db.team,
                        attributes:["team_name"]
                    }
                })
