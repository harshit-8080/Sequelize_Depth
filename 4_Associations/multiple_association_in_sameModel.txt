1.  In Sequelize, it is possible to define multiple associations between the same models. 

2.  You just have to define different aliases for them.

3.  Example :-
    
    Team.hasOne(Game, { as: 'HomeTeam', foreignKey: 'homeTeamId' });
    Team.hasOne(Game, { as: 'AwayTeam', foreignKey: 'awayTeamId' });
    Game.belongsTo(Team);
