1.  The concepts of Eager Loading and Lazy Loading are fundamental to understand how fetching associations work in Sequelize.


2.  Lazy Loading refers to the technique of fetching the associated data only when you really want it.


3.  Eager Loading refers to the technique of fetching everything at once, since the beginning, with a larger query.


4.  Example :- (Lazy Loading)

    1.  Relation :-
            Captain.hasOne(Ship);
            Ship.belongsTo(Captain);

    2.  Query :-
            const awesomeCaptain = await Captain.findOne({
                where: {
                    name: "Jack Sparrow"
                }
            });
    
    3. Now We want info about his Ship.
            const hisShip = await awesomeCaptain.getShip();



5.  Example :- (Eager Loading)

    1.  Relation :-
            Captain.hasOne(Ship);
            Ship.belongsTo(Captain);

    2.  Query :-
            const awesomeCaptain = await Captain.findOne({
                where: {
                        name: "Jack Sparrow"
                },
                include: Ship
            });
    
    3. Here we have all information
            // Now the ship comes with it
            console.log('Name:', awesomeCaptain.name);
            console.log('Skill Level:', awesomeCaptain.skillLevel);
            console.log('Ship Name:', awesomeCaptain.ship.name);
            console.log('Amount of Sails:', awesomeCaptain.ship.amountOfSails);
