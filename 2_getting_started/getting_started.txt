1.  Install Sequelize :-

        npm install --save sequelize


2. After installing sequelize package, We need to install driver for our database :-

        npm install pg pghstore -> postgres
        npm install mariadb
        npm install mysql2

        etc

3.  Next Step will be to connect to database, We can use either of below options :-

        const {Sequelize} =   require("sequelize");

        const sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname') 

        or 

        const sequelize = new Sequelize(database, username, password, {
            host:localhost,
            port:5432
            dialect: postgres,
        })     


4.  Test the connection :- 

        try{
            await sequelize.authenticate();
            console.log("connection established")
        }catch(error){
            console.log("connection failed")
        }



5.  We can close connection as well and it returns a promise.
        sequelize.close();


6.  By default sequelize log every sql query in console but we can control as well by make logging:false while creating sequelize instance.
